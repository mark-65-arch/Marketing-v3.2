- **/init**  
  Creates a CLAUDE.md file to store context, memory, and project notes.

- **/clear**  
  Wipes the current conversation context and starts fresh.

  Summarizes and trims history to save tokens and reduce clutter.

- **/review**  
  Asks Claude to review code, PRs, or specific files you reference.

## üß† Best Practices

- **Maintain CLAUDE.md**  
  Keeps style guides, conventions, or notes that Claude will always read.

- **Use Plan Mode**  
  Slows Claude down to plan before acting, improves reliability.

- **Check verbose logs**  
  See what context Claude is using and how it reasons.

- **Inject shell output with !**  
  Example: `!git status` shares live command results with Claude.

- **Reset often**  
  Start fresh with /clear when switching tasks to avoid confusion.

- **Parallel sessions**  
  Run separate REPLs per project or domain to keep focus clean.

- **Use IDE integration**  
  Connect Claude directly in VS Code or other supported editors.
