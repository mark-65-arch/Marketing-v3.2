## Additional Notes

1. **Native Spanish Review Recommended**: While the translations are professional and follow legal Spanish conventions, a native Spanish-speaking legal professional should review before public deployment to ensure complete accuracy and appropriateness for the target audience.

2. **Regional Variations**: These translations use neutral Spanish that should be understood across all Spanish-speaking regions. If targeting a specific market (e.g., Spain vs. Latin America), minor adjustments may be beneficial.

3. **Ongoing Maintenance**: When English legal pages are updated, corresponding Spanish pages must be updated to maintain synchronization.

4. **Analytics**: Consider setting up separate analytics tracking for Spanish pages to measure engagement and identify any UX issues specific to Spanish-speaking users.
