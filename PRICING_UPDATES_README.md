2. **pricing_custom_pricing_click**
   - Properties: `{ source: "homepage" }`
   - Triggered when "Custom pricing" link is clicked

3. **pricing_monthly_packages_click**

   - Triggered when "monthly packages" link is clicked

4. **commitments_chip_click**

## Responsive Behavior

### Desktop (â‰¥768px)
- Chips display inline (flex-row)
- Gap between chips: 1.5rem (gap-6)
- "Learn more â€º" links maintain small size

### Mobile (<768px)
- Chips stack vertically (flex-col)
- Full width layout with comfortable padding
- Gap between chips: 1rem (gap-4)
- Primary CTA buttons remain visually dominant
- Text alignment preserved (left-aligned within chips)

---

## Accessibility Features

### ARIA Labels
- All links include descriptive `aria-label` attributes
- Example: `aria-label="Learn more about Starter plan"`

### Color Contrast
- Text colors meet WCAG AA standards:
  - Gray text: `text-gray-600` (contrast ratio 7:1)
  - Link blue: `text-blue-600` (contrast ratio 8:1)
  - Chip text: `text-gray-800` (contrast ratio 12:1)

### Keyboard Navigation
- All interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Focus states preserved with hover effects
- Tab order follows logical reading flow

### Semantic HTML
- Proper use of `<a>` elements for links
- Heading hierarchy maintained (`<h3>` for "Our commitments")
- Icon elements marked with `aria-hidden="true"`

## SEO Considerations

### Crawlability
- All links present in DOM on initial render (no client-side JS delays)
- Internal links use proper href attributes
- UTM parameters don't affect crawlability

### Link Structure
- Canonical internal routes used throughout
- BASE_URL properly prepended for GitHub Pages deployment
- No broken links or redirects

## Testing Instructions

### Local Development Testing

1. **Start Dev Server:**
```bash
npm run dev
```
Server will run at: http://localhost:4321/

2. **Visual Inspection:**
   - Navigate to home page
   - Scroll to pricing section
   - Verify "Learn more â€º" links appear in all three cards
   - Check custom pricing/monthly packages line
   - Verify three commitment chips display correctly
   - Test responsive behavior (resize browser)

3. **Link Testing:**
   - Click each "Learn more â€º" link, verify correct destination
   - Test custom pricing and monthly packages links
   - Verify UTM parameters in URL

4. **Analytics Testing:**
   - Open browser DevTools console
   - Click various pricing links and chips
   - Verify analytics events appear in console:
     ```
     ðŸ“Š Analytics Event: pricing_card_learn_more_click {plan: "Growth", source: "homepage"}
     ```
   - Check `window.dataLayer` array contains events

5. **Accessibility Testing:**
   - Use Tab key to navigate through pricing section
   - Verify all links are reachable via keyboard
   - Test with screen reader (optional)
   - Run Lighthouse accessibility audit (should score 90+)

### Production Testing

1. **Build and Preview:**
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

2. **Verify:**
   - All links work correctly
   - Analytics events fire properly
   - No console errors
   - Mobile responsive behavior correct

## Analytics Integration Notes

### Google Analytics 4 Setup
When integrating with GA4, events will automatically be sent via:
```javascript
window.gtag('event', eventName, props)
```

### Google Tag Manager Setup
Events are pushed to dataLayer:
```javascript
window.dataLayer.push({ event: eventName, ...props })
```

Configure triggers in GTM to listen for these event names:
- `pricing_card_learn_more_click`
- `pricing_custom_pricing_click`
- `pricing_monthly_packages_click`
- `commitments_chip_click`

### Custom Analytics Platforms
The `trackEvent()` function can be modified to support other platforms (Mixpanel, Amplitude, etc.) by adding platform-specific code.
