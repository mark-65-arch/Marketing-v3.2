## Known Issues / Limitations

1. **Hreflang Tags**: Not yet implemented. Need to add `<link rel="alternate" hreflang="en" href="...">` and `<link rel="alternate" hreflang="es" href="...">` tags to all pages to indicate language alternatives for SEO.

2. **Language Selector**: No language switcher UI component exists. Users must manually navigate to `/es/` URLs.

3. **Mixed Content**: One testimonial quote ("Local HVAC company ‚Äî 35% increase in organic calls in 90 days") remains in English as it's a quoted metric/case study.

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual QA Steps
1. **Visual Comparison**:
   - Open English page and Spanish page side-by-side
   - Verify layout, spacing, and visual hierarchy match
   - Check for text overflow or truncation issues

2. **Link Testing**:
   - Click all CTAs on Spanish pages
   - Verify they lead to Spanish destinations (not English)
   - Test breadcrumb navigation

3. **Form Testing**:
   - Submit contact form from Spanish page
   - Verify Google Form submission works
   - Check email notifications arrive correctly

4. **Mobile Testing**:
   - Test on mobile viewport (375px, 414px widths)
   - Verify touch targets are accessible
   - Check accordion expand/collapse on touch devices

5. **SEO Validation**:
   - Run Google Rich Results Test on Spanish pages
   - Verify structured data validates correctly
   - Check meta tags with SEO browser extensions

### Automated Testing (Future)
- [ ] Add Playwright tests for Spanish routes
- [ ] Add accessibility tests (axe-core) for Spanish content
- [ ] Add visual regression tests (Percy/Chromatic)
