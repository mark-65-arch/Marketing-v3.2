            <h2>4. Proposals, Contracts, and Order of Precedence</h2>
            <p>A signed proposal, statement of work, or agreement is required to begin paid Services.</p>

            <h2>5. Payments, Invoicing, Payment Disputes, and Late Payment</h2>

            <h3>5.A Payments and Invoicing</h3>
            <p>Fees are as set forth in each proposal, invoice, or signed agreement. Unless otherwise stated, invoices are due within 14 days of the invoice date. Client is responsible for all taxes, duties, or similar charges unless otherwise agreed in writing.</p>
            <p>We may require deposits, milestone payments, or prepayment for certain Services; work will not commence or will be paused until required payments are received.</p>
            <p>We reserve the right to suspend or withhold Deliverables for overdue accounts. Overdue amounts accrue interest at 1.5% per month or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower, plus all costs of collection, including reasonable attorneys' fees.</p>

            <h3>5.B Payment Disputes</h3>
            <p>If Client disputes an invoice, Client must notify Marketing AI Houston in writing within 14 days of the invoice date, specifying the invoice number, disputed amount, and reason for dispute. Failure to timely notify will waive the right to dispute the invoice.</p>
            <p>Client must pay any undisputed portion of the invoice by the due date. Marketing AI Houston will promptly investigate bona fide disputes and attempt in good faith to resolve them. If a dispute is resolved in Client's favor, we will issue an appropriate credit or refund.</p>
            <p>While a bona fide dispute is being resolved, neither party will commence any legal action for the disputed amount except as necessary to preserve rights. Marketing AI Houston may suspend Services for continued nonpayment after providing seven (7) days' written notice.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>6. Refunds, Cancellations, Retainers, and Recurring Services</h2>

            <h3>6.A Retainers and Prepaid Work</h3>
            <p>Retainers or prepayments, if required, will be applied to future invoices for Services. Unless otherwise specified in a signed agreement, retainer fees are non-refundable but will be credited against final invoices for Services rendered. If Client terminates a signed agreement, any unused retainer balance after deduction of performed work and expenses will be returned within 30 days, subject to the deduction of outstanding fees, expenses, and reasonable wind‑down costs.</p>

            <h3>6.B Subscriptions, Hosting, and Recurring Services</h3>
            <p>Recurring services (including subscriptions and hosting) are billed in advance according to the billing cycle set out in the applicable order or agreement. Recurring billing continues until cancelled. Cancellations must be submitted in writing and will take effect at the end of the then‑current billing period. No pro‑rated refunds will be issued for partial billing periods unless expressly stated in the applicable agreement.</p>
            <p>Marketing AI Houston is not responsible for data retention after cancellation unless a separate data‑retention arrangement is agreed and paid for; Clients should export or request their data prior to cancellation.</p>

            <h3>6.C Cancellations, Termination, and Refund Eligibility</h3>
            <p>Except as otherwise stated in a signed agreement, refunds are not provided for work already performed or for time and materials services once work has commenced. If Client cancels a project prior to substantial performance, Client will pay for all work performed up to the cancellation date, plus any non‑recoverable third‑party costs.</p>
            <p>If Marketing AI Houston terminates a signed agreement for Client's material breach, Client remains liable for all fees incurred and for reasonable costs to wind down the project. If Marketing AI Houston terminates for convenience, Marketing AI Houston will refund any prepayment for Services not yet performed, less reasonable wind‑down costs.</p>
